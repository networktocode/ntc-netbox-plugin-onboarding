[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/networktocode/ntc-netbox-plugin-onboarding.svg?token=29s5AiDXdkDPwzSmDpxg&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/networktocode/ntc-netbox-plugin-onboarding)

A plugin for [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) to easily onboard new devices.

`ntc-netbox-plugin-onboarding` is using [Netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko), [NAPALM](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) & [Django-RQ](https://github.com/rq/django-rq) to simplify the onboarding process of a new device into NetBox down to an IP Address and a site.
The goal of this plugin is not to import everything about a device into NetBox but rather to help build quickly an inventory in NetBox that is often the first step into an automation journey.

## Installation

The plugin is available as a Python package in pypi and can be installed with pip
```shell
pip install ntc-netbox-plugin-onboarding
```

> The plugin is compatible with NetBox 2.8.1 and higher
 
To ensure NetBox Onboarding plugin is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the NetBox root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `ntc-netbox-plugin-onboarding` package:

```no-highlight
# echo ntc-netbox-plugin-onboarding >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your `configuration.py`
```python
# In your configuration.py
PLUGINS = ["netbox_onboarding"]

# PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
#   "netbox_onboarding": {
#     ADD YOUR SETTINGS HERE
#   }
# }
```

Finally, make sure to run the migrations for this plugin

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

The plugin behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings

- `create_platform_if_missing` boolean (default True), If True, a new platform object will be created if the platform discovered by netmiko do not already exist and is in the list of supported platforms (`cisco_ios`, `cisco_nxos`, `arista_eos`, `juniper_junos`, `cisco_xr`)
- `create_device_type_if_missing` boolean (default True), If True, a new device type object will be created if the model discovered by Napalm do not match an existing device type.
- `create_manufacturer_if_missing` boolean (default True), If True, a new manufacturer object will be created if the manufacturer discovered by Napalm is do not match an existing manufacturer, this option is only valid if `create_device_type_if_missing` is True as well.
- `create_device_role_if_missing` boolean (default True), If True, a new device role object will be created if the device role provided was not provided as part of the onboarding and if the `default_device_role` do not already exist.
- `create_management_interface_if_missing` boolean (default True), If True, add management interface and IP address to the device. If False no management interfaces will be created, nor will the IP address be added to NetBox, while the device will still get added.
- `default_device_status` string (default "active"), status assigned to a new device by default (must be lowercase).
- `default_device_role` string (default "network")
- `default_device_role_color` string (default FF0000), color assigned to the device role if it needs to be created.
- `default_management_interface` string (default "PLACEHOLDER"), name of the management interface that will be created, if one can't be identified on the device.
- `default_management_prefix_length` integer ( default 0), length of the prefix that will be used for the management IP address, if the IP can't be found.
- `platform_map` (dictionary), mapping of an **auto-detected** Netmiko platform to the **NetBox slug** name of your Platform. The dictionary should be in the format:
    ```python
    {
      <Netmiko Platform>: <NetBox Slug> 
    }
    ```
- `object_match_strategy` (string), defines the method for searching models. There are
currently two strategies, strict and loose. Strict has to be a direct match, normally 
using a slug. Loose allows a range of search criteria to match a single object. If multiple
objects are returned an error is raised. 

## Usage

### Preparation

To work properly the plugin needs to know the Site, Platform, Device Type, Device Role of each
device as well as its primary IP address or DNS Name. It's recommended to create these objects in
NetBox ahead of time and to provide them when you want to start the onboarding process.

> For DNS Name Resolution to work, the instance of NetBox must be able to resolve the name of the
> device to IP address.

If `Platform`, `Device Type` and/or `Device Role` are not provided, the plugin will try to identify these information automatically and, based on the settings, it can create them in NetBox as needed.
> If the Platform is provided, it must contains a valid Napalm driver available to the worker in Python

### Onboard a new device

A new device can be onboarded via :
- A web form  `/plugins/onboarding/add/`
- A CSV form to import multiple devices in bulk. `/plugins/onboarding/import/`
- An API, `POST /api/plugins​/onboarding​/onboarding​/`

During a successful onboarding process, a new device will be created in NetBox with its management interface and its primary IP assigned. The management interface will be discovered on the device based on the IP address provided.

> By default, the plugin is using the credentials defined in the main `configuration.py` for Napalm (`NAPALM_USERNAME`/`NAPALM_PASSWORD`). It's possible to define specific credentials for each onboarding task.

### Consult the status of onboarding tasks

The status of the onboarding process for each device is maintained is a dedicated table in NetBox and can be retrived :
- Via the UI `/plugins/onboarding/`
- Via the API `GET /api/plugins​/onboarding​/onboarding​/`

### API

The plugin includes 4 API endpoints to manage the onbarding tasks

```shell
GET        /api/plugins​/onboarding​/onboarding​/       Check status of all onboarding tasks.
POST    ​   /api/plugins​/onboarding​/onboarding​/       Onboard a new device
GET     ​   /api/plugins​/onboarding​/onboarding​/{id}​/  Check the status of a specific onboarding task
DELETE    ​ /api/plugins​/onboarding​/onboarding​/{id}​/  Delete a specific onboarding task
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed and automatically built and tested against multiple version of Python and multiple version of NetBox through TravisCI.

The project is packaged with a light development environment based on `docker-compose` to help with the local development of the project and to run the tests within TravisCI.

The project is following Network to Code software development guideline and is leveraging:
- Black, Pylint, Bandit and pydocstyle for Python linting and formatting.
- Django unit test to ensure the plugin is working properly.

### CLI Helper Commands

The project is coming with a CLI helper based on [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to help setup the development environment. The commands are listed below in 3 categories `dev environment`, `utility` and `testing`. 

Each command can be executed with `invoke <command>`. All commands support the arguments `--netbox-ver` and `--python-ver` if you want to manually define the version of Python and NetBox to use. Each command also has its own help `invoke <command> --help`
